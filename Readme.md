## Core LangChain Concepts Covered

The essential components and architecture of the LangChain framework to build powerful LLM-powered applications.

- **Fundamentals of LangChain:** Understand the core principles and its role in the Generative AI landscape.
- **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL):** Master the syntax to chain components and build robust applications.
- **Chatbot Development:** Build intelligent chatbots with conversational memory to maintain context.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Develop advanced RAG pipelines to query documents and external knowledge bases, reducing hallucinations and improving accuracy.
- **Tools & Agents:** Learn to create and use agents that can perform actions, such as searching the web or querying databases.
- **SQL & Database Integration:** Build applications that can understand natural language and interact with SQL databases.
- **Graph Databases:** Get an introduction to graph databases and the Cypher query language for creating knowledge graphs.
- **LangGraph & CrewAI:** Explore multi-agent systems by building stateful applications with LangGraph and creating autonomous agent crews with CrewAI.
