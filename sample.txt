OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 Turbo model offers a cost-effective alternative to GPT-4 with higher performance and a significantly extended context length of up to 128,000 tokens. While it supports most of the same capabilities as GPT-4, Turbo has usage limits depending on the API plan. For example, the free-tier ChatGPT users can send up to 40 messages every 3 hours, while Plus users are allotted up to 100 messages per 3 hours. These limits are enforced to balance performance across users and may change depending on demand and system stability. Additionally, developers integrating Turbo via the API may encounter rate limits such as tokens-per-minute (TPM) and requests-per-minute (RPM), which can be adjusted by applying for rate limit increases.
